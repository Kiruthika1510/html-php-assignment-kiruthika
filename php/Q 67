67. Construct a program that tokenizes a sentence into words using regular expressions. Then, count the
number of occurrences of each word and display the results.
<?php
// Sample sentence
$sentence = "PHP is great. PHP is powerful! PHP is easy to learn.";

// Step 1: Convert sentence to lowercase (optional for case-insensitive counting)
$sentence = strtolower($sentence);

// Step 2: Tokenize sentence into words using regex
// \w+ matches sequences of letters, digits, and underscores
preg_match_all('/\w+/', $sentence, $matches);

// $matches[0] now contains all words
$words = $matches[0];

// Step 3: Count occurrences of each word
$wordCounts = array_count_values($words);

// Step 4: Display the results
echo "Word Occurrences:\n";
foreach ($wordCounts as $word => $count) {
    echo "$word : $count\n";
}
?>
