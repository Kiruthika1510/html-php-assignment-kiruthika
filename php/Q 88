88. Generate a simple PHP 'birthday countdown' script, the script will count the number of days
between current day and birthday.
code:
<?php
// Set your birthday (month and day)
$birthdayMonth = 12;
$birthdayDay = 25;

// Get current year and date
$year = date("Y");
$today = date("Y-m-d");

// Create birthday date for this year
$birthdayThisYear = date("Y-m-d", strtotime("$year-$birthdayMonth-$birthdayDay"));

// If birthday has already passed this year, set for next year
if(strtotime($birthdayThisYear) < strtotime($today)) {
    $year += 1;
    $birthdayThisYear = date("Y-m-d", strtotime("$year-$birthdayMonth-$birthdayDay"));
}

// Calculate difference in seconds
$diffSeconds = strtotime($birthdayThisYear) - strtotime($today);

// Convert seconds to days
$daysRemaining = ceil($diffSeconds / (60 * 60 * 24));

echo "<h3>Birthday Countdown</h3>";
echo "There are <strong>$daysRemaining</strong> days remaining until your birthday!";
?>
