75. Build a PHP function that takes the filename and a new line of content as input. Append the new
line of content as a new line at the end of the file.
code:
<?php
// Function to append a line to a file
function appendLineToFile($filename, $newLine) {
    // Add a newline character at the end
    $newLineWithBreak = $newLine . PHP_EOL;

    // Append the line to the file
    if(file_put_contents($filename, $newLineWithBreak, FILE_APPEND)) {
        echo "New line added successfully to '$filename'.";
    } else {
        echo "Error: Could not write to file '$filename'.";
    }
}

// Example usage
$filename = "myfile.txt";
$newContent = "This is a new line appended to the file.";

appendLineToFile($filename, $newContent);
?>
