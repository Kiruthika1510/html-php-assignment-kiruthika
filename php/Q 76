76. Write a simple 'birthday countdown' script, the script will count the number of days between
current day and birthday.
code:
<?php
// Set your birthday (month and day)
$birthday = "2025-12-25"; // Format: YYYY-MM-DD

// Get current date
$today = date("Y-m-d");

// Convert dates to timestamps
$todayTime = strtotime($today);
$birthdayTime = strtotime($birthday);

// If birthday has already passed this year, set to next year
if($birthdayTime < $todayTime) {
    $year = date("Y") + 1;
    $birthdayTime = strtotime($year . "-" . date("m-d", strtotime($birthday)));
}

// Calculate difference in seconds
$diffSeconds = $birthdayTime - $todayTime;

// Convert seconds to days
$daysRemaining = ceil($diffSeconds / (60 * 60 * 24));

echo "<h3>Birthday Countdown</h3>";
echo "There are <strong>$daysRemaining</strong> days remaining until your birthday!";
?>
