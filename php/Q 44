44. Develop a music playlist management system for a streaming service. The system should allow users to
create, modify, and organize playlists. How would you use arrays and array functions to store and
manipulate the song data and playlist information efficiently?
code:
<?php
// Step 1: Master library of songs (id => song details)
$library = array(
    1 => "Shape of You - Ed Sheeran",
    2 => "Blinding Lights - The Weeknd",
    3 => "Levitating - Dua Lipa",
    4 => "Believer - Imagine Dragons",
    5 => "Senorita - Shawn Mendes"
);

// Step 2: User playlists (associative array)
$playlists = array(
    "Workout" => array(1, 4),   // songs by ID
    "Chill"   => array(2, 5)
);

// Step 3: Functions for playlist management
function addSong(&$playlist, $songId) {
    if (!in_array($songId, $playlist)) {
        array_push($playlist, $songId);
    }
}

function removeSong(&$playlist, $songId) {
    $playlist = array_diff($playlist, array($songId));
}

function showPlaylist($playlistName, $playlist, $library) {
    echo "<b>Playlist: $playlistName</b><br>";
    foreach ($playlist as $songId) {
        echo "- " . $library[$songId] . "<br>";
    }
    echo "<br>";
}

// Step 4: Add & Remove songs
addSong($playlists["Workout"], 3); // Add "Levitating" to Workout
removeSong($playlists["Chill"], 5); // Remove "Senorita" from Chill

// Step 5: Display playlists
foreach ($playlists as $name => $songs) {
    showPlaylist($name, $songs, $library);
}
?>
